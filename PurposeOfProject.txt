This project is our final project in software engineering education. The aim of this project is to help patients with amblyopia.
 We aimed to address the children by designing this treatment process as a game. The difference between the other applications
 in the market is the game score  of the patient will be kept in the database  and these scores will be seen by the doctor. 
This analysis part is web based. The data is historically seen on the chart. The doctor first analyzes the data  by looking 
at the graph of choosed patients data (which weaknesses in seeing the points) and then enters and records point values to 
create a new game based on this analysis. Then the person with lazy eye disease can select and play the game created by the 
doctor in the game menu. In this way, the treatment process is followed and analyzed by the doctor.
Lazy Eye Project's game part was made using Unity Game Engine and Visual Studio.net  and it's web based part was made using PHP
and in it's database part , MySQL was used.
